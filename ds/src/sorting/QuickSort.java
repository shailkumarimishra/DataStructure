/*
 * 1. Quick Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm
 * 2. At each step find pivot and then make sure all the smaller elements are on the
 *    left of pivot & all Bigger elements are on the right of pivot.
 * 3. It does this recursively until the entire array is sorted.
 * 4. Unlike merge sort it does not require any extra space.
 * e.g; 9,4,6,3,7,1,2,11,5
 * Note:- Assume p is pivot element & j is first element(j=0) and i=-1;
 * compare j<=p then swap i & j.
