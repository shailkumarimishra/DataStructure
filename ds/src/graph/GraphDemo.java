/*
 * Graph:- Graph is a pair of sets (V,E) where V is the set of vertices and E is the set
 * 		   of edges connecting the pair of vertices. 
 * 
 * Terminology of Graph:-
 * 1. Vertices-> Vertices are the nodes of the graph.
 * 2. Edges-> Edges are arc that connect pair of Vertices.
 * 3. UnWeighted Graph-> A Graph not having a weight associated with any edge.
 * 4. Weighted Graph-> A Graph having weight associated with edge.
 * 5. Directed Graph-> It is a Graph that is a set of Vertices connected by edges where
 * 					   the edges have a direction associated with them.
 * 6.UnDirected Graph->It is a Graph that is a set of Vertices connected by edges where
 * 					   the edges do not have direction associated with them.
 * 7.Acyclic Graph-> A Graph having no loop.
 * 8.Cyclic Graph-> A Graph having loop.
 * 
 * Types Of Graph:-
 * 1. Directed Graph and Undirected Graph
 * 2. Directed Weighted and Directed UnWeighted Graph.
 * 3. UnDirected Weighted and UnDirected UnWeighted Graph.
 * 4. Directed Positive Weighted Graph and Directed Negative Weighted Graph.
 * 5. UnDirected Positive Weighted Graph and UnDirected Negative Weighted Graph.
 * 
 * Note:- A tree is a special type of Graph (Acyclic,UnDirected) but vice versa is not
 * 		  true.
